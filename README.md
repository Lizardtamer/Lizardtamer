## My Background

My name is Ben. I am originally from **suburban Atlanta**, and I've lived in Memphis for **almost** three years.

I was in the military for 9-years. I was a **Hospital Corpsman** (HM) in the Navy :anchor: . Our jobs are to be combat medics for the Navy and the Marine Corps. I specialized as a Field Medical Training Technician, and I was assigned primarily with Marine Corps units for six of my nine years.

I was stationed at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) in **Bethesda, MD.** Then I was stationed in **Camp Lejeune, NC.** where I was assigned to 2nd Marine Division- primarily with 2nd Combat Engineer Battalion and subsequently deployed with an infantry battalion (2nd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment) to the Middle East.

I was then reassigned on an independent assignment to **Pittsburgh, PA.** with Company A, 4th Medical Battalion and relocated to **Millington, TN.** where I decided to stay in nearby Memphis, and get out of the military to pursue other opportunities- namely in the music industry :musical_note:.

## My Bands

I have two active bands currently:

[**Banales**](https://www.instagram.com/banales.tn/) is a post-hardcore band. I am the vocalist and use a sampler, but I also used to play bass in the band too.

[**Crum. B**](https://www.instagram.com/crumb.901/) is a post-punk grungegaze noisey jam band, and I play guitar and do vocals and also use my sampler. We recently just recorded and the mixes are almost ready for release. It's a 35-min release we're going to call **"Male Living Space"** which has 6 songs lol.

## My Other Interests

I like weight lifting and rock climbing. I climb at Memphis Rox. I've been nursing a chronic foot injury for a couple of months so my weight lifting hasn't been as much up to speed.

I'm also an avid rhythm gamer. I used to play Pump It Up and Dance Dance Revolution at Dave & Busters like 3-4 times a week when I was younger haha.

I also enjoy reading. One of my favorite books in Siddhartha by Herman Hesse and this is one of my favorite quotes from the book:

> "I can think.
> I can wait.
> I can fast."
